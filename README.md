This code is a trading indicator built off the thinkScript programming language. It plots out standard deviation levels as well as the occasional buy or sell point of when the algorithm believes is a good time to long or short based on the technicals 

I've included a rough translation into C for anyone that wishes to use it with various other packages for platforms like IBKR or NinjaTrader, but the languages do not translate very well, and a good amount of work is still needed. However, the thinkScript version should be fully functional for anyone that wishes to use this on ThinkorSwim.
